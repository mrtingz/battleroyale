# Rules and Help Guide

### Please note that this gamemode is very new, and bugs are very much possible.

- Your main objective is to be the last player standing by any means not against the rules.
- The city and airport have the greatest amount of loot, but are therefore much more dangerous.
- Stay within the safe zone or you will start to become damaged.
- Look for vehicles around the map to get you to the zone faster.
- The last person standing is given pointshop points.

- Hit 'T' to toggle first or third person views.
- Hit 'F3' to toggle the Pointshop.
- Type "/drop" to drop your current weapon.
- Hit 'Ctrl' twice to toggle prone.

- No cheating in any form. This includes ghosting, hacking of any kind, or anything that gives you an unfair advantage.
- You are only allowed to team with one person and one person ONLY. Punishment is up to the admin handling the issue. This is due to many complaints regarding large teams.
